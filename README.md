R language is highly popular in the statistical field, with many innovative statistical methods being released as R packages. This study aims to implement Generalized association plots (GAP) for interval data in R, supported by a vast repository of symbolic interval data and algorithmic packages in R. GAP is an extension of Matrix visualization (MV). 

Focusing particularly on the Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of symbolic interval data, the study facilitates data to narrate its story before applying complex statistical methods. To this end, we have developed a package named iGAP, integrating the GAP concept into R, enabling the arrangement and visualization of interval data for users to quickly and clearly understand the relationships and patterns within the data. We believe that GAP, as an advanced tool for EDA in R, can be applied to interval data and potentially extended to various data types in the future.
